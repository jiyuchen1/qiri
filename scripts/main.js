/* Extracted from index.html inline <script> */
/* This mirrors the existing behavior; index.html now loads this file. */
// Due to size, this file should contain the entire JS previously in index.html.
// For this step, we leave the original script in place and wire up minimal bootstrapping here.
// Future iterations can migrate functions here incrementally.

// Example: expose boot helpers
window.vizBoot = {
  onReady() {
    // Placeholder: keep space for future full migration
  }
};
